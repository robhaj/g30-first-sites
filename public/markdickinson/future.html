        I decided to take the leap and start my life over fresh in G-school around 6 months ago.  I am very excited to start my new life, doing something that I <strong><em>Love</em></strong>!
        I don't have any specific career goals in mind at the moment.  However, I do know that I enjoy coding and am sure I will enjoy wherever I work!
