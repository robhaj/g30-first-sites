      <h3>History</h3>

        Our story begins in the year 1990 when our owner and founder, George, decided to pursue his dream of opening a crabshack on the beach.  At the time he was broke, so to raise money, he held a series of carwash fundraisers with scantily clad senior citizens.  The carwash was such a success with the local community, he was able to raise $50,000 in just a few months.

      <h3>Our People</h3>
      <img class="inline-stock-photo" src="http://funny-pics-fun.com/wp-content/uploads/Very-Funny-People-Faces-18.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Our people are our greatest asset.  Without them, we would struggle to continuously deliver the best crabs this side of the Mississippi.  Our head chef, Charlie, who we call "Crabby Charlie," has been in the business for over 40 years and has had his fair share of crabs. He runs the kitchen, while our head server, Jack, manages the dining staff.

      <p>
        Our food is probably the best you'll ever taste (and this website is not in anyway indicative of the quality of our totally madeup cuisine).  When you come to this restaurant, you will feel at home as we cook you some authentic homemade seafood.  Start small, don't fill up on apps, and finish it off with some of the best quality fish you'll ever have.  Guaranteed to keep you coming back.
