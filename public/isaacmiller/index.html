      <h2>A little about me</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Isaac McGaha Miller. I was born and raised in Fort
        Collins, CO and have been in Denver for about 8 years, with pitstops in
        Greeley (getting a degree in English) and Brooklyn (living out hipster
        fantasies). I am a former touring musician and radio DJ and I currently still
        do some voice acting on the side.</p>
        <p>I am engaged to a wonderful woman named Simone who is a marriage and family
        therapist. We've been together for two and half years and plan to get married
        in September 2017.</p>
        <p>We have a chihuahua mix together named Cyrus, who is an
        adorable jerk.</p>
