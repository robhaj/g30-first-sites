        <h3>My current future</h3>
        <p> After graduating from CU I practiced Civil Engineering for 3 years.
            <br> I decided about 6 months ago that the field of Web Development was a much more exciting field to be in.
            <br>I have always been fascinated with computers and what made them tick, it will be exciting to contribute to the field of technology! </p>


        <h3>Where I'd like to be</h3>
        <p>After Galvanize, I would love to test my skills at a smaller company where I could get a well rounded arsenal as well as be involved in the business end of the operation.
            <br> After that I would love to play in the NBA and go to outer space.
            <br>The last two might not be as likely â€“ but I am not giving up hope just yet.</p>
