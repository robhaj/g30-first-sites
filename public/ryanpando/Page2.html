      <p>I have been around computers since my parents bought me my first one when I was seven.  I remember messing around with DOS on my 286dx trying to get a sound card to work with F117a flight simulator, editing .ini files and messing with HIMEM.  I started out playing Legend of the Red Dragon, Mule, and Arrow on bulletin board systems where you called in to a tiny server with a modem before the internet was opened to the public.  My brother got kicked off the BBS by the admin for calling Jenny Mccarthy, yes the one on TV, a whore for distributing her modeling pictures on the public storage.  I feel that I may have missed a great opportunity to make my youthful hobby into a career, but as they say, there is no time like the present.</p>

        <p class="clear right wrapper"> I feel like a happy dancing dinosaur.  A meteor may be coming, but grabs someone elses tail and party!</p>

      <p>My half brother, Jarod Ferguson, is a founder of a successful startup in Boise Idaho called Royal Jay (clickable link):</p>

      <p class="clear">When I told him of his dissatisfaction with my current work environment and my interest in getting back into computers as a career, he suggested I try one of the bootcamps out in Denver.  He said the focus on Javascript and the NEAP stack at Galvanize looked better for enterprise employability than the mostly Ruby on Rails focus of the other boot camps in the area.  Once I got on codewars and did the technical interview I knew I had a love for the problem solving aspect of web site developement.  I know my website looks like a myspace era reject, but I am sure with more practice, layout design will become more natural.
