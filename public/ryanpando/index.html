        <p> Hello, my name is Ryan Pando and I like pig butts and I cannot lie, you other brothers cannot deny, when you   see that smokey bark you want some. Well, that and slathered in a good mop.  I am an old school computer/gaming   nerd, cook/baker, and recently a father.</p>

        <p>I am originally from Salt Lake City, Utah, but I lived most of my life in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I attended the University of Nevada, Reno for college before moving out to Colorado after the 2008 job market imploded in <strike>Nevada</strike> the entire country.</p>

        <p> I met my wife just four years ago.  After taking her on adventures like accidentally getting her dosed with psilocybin, busting up her knee and then having to have her walk down a mountain for 6 miles, and rock climbing when she is deathly afraid of heights she made the questionable decision of marrying me in April of 2013.</p>

        <p>I worked at Advanced Thin Films, a laser optics manufacturing company, for most of my time here in Denver.  Noted projects that you may have heard of that I worked on were the MIT LIGO gravity telescope optics and the Holometer for Fermilab.  Unfortunately the thin films space is very small and insular and I didn't feel like I could grow my career in a satisfactory way without a graduate degree and I ain't got time for that as I believe a great philosopher once said.</p>
