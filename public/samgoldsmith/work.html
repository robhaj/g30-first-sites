    <h2>Past</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>I was introduced to Denverâ€™s technology and startup community when I worked at a business incubator in DTC.</ul>
        <ul>I wanted to dive a little deeper into the technology side, so I moved into a role in IT staffing. Someone once described IT staffing to me like this: Recruiters are like sports agents. They know the sport, they love the sport, and they can talk it. They just can't play it. Since I couldn't play, I found people who could.</ul>
        <ul>Turns out I wanted to be one of those people, so I left IT staffing and began working for a temporary architecture company. I thought it would be a huge career shift, but it was quite serendipitous, actually. I found a spot on their event systems team where we built front-facing databases for large-scale, sporting event operations.</ul>

    <h2>Present</h2>
      <ul>I'm ready to take the next step, and I'm really stoked to be doing it at Galvanize! I will admit: I'm a bit nervous; this is all very much outside my comfort zone. I took a Javascript workshop at Galvanize in the spring, and it was a lot of fun! I haven't done much front-end work, so I'm looking forward to getting more comfortable with that. I'm also excited to collaborate; I find that I work well sorting through problems with my peers.</ul>

    <h2>Future</h2>
        <ul>I'm going to make like Bill and be proud of the work I've done to become a programmer. I hope to stay in Denver and work with one of the many awesome startups here. That seems like an ideal environment to wear a lot of hats and have a hand in all kinds of different things (front and back.)</ul>
